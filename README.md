Refrigerator Door is an interactive installation that features movable magnetic letters attached to an acrylic panel. Viewers can move around letters on the board, and when letters come into a certain distance with another, letters are projected onto the panel that complete the word. Attempting to recreate the nostalgia of playing with letters on a refrigerator door as a child while also creating an engaging experience for today’s children, the piece combines a physical interface through the alphabet magnets along with a digital interface through the projected letters.

This installation was developed entirely using OpenFrameworks, and uses the addon ofxAruco for consistent marker tracking. The markers are tracked using a PS3Eye Camera, taking advantage of its infrared camera.
