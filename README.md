# Refrigerator Door
Refrigerator Door is an interactive installation that features movable magnetic letters attached to an acrylic panel. Viewers can move around letters on the board, and when letters come into a certain distance with another, letters are projected onto the panel that complete the word. Attempting to recreate the nostalgia of playing with letters on a refrigerator door as a child while also creating an engaging experience for todayâ€™s children, the piece combines a physical interface through the alphabet magnets along with a digital interface through the projected letters.

This installation was developed entirely using OpenFrameworks, and uses the addon ofxAruco for consistent marker tracking. The markers are tracked using a PS3Eye Camera, taking advantage of its infrared camera.
